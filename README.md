## Full Stack Development 101

This repo prototype a custom web app using Django and Vue.js. This is an introductory hands-on project that I'll be learning about Django and Vue.js

## Python + JavaScript

I'll set a publishing project with a basic database schema to save bands and albumns, and a minimal interface (UI) to interact with them.


## Running the code

If you want to log as admin, you need to create a superuser:
```bash
(venv) $ python manage.py createsuperuser
```

To run a local server, run:
```bash
(venv) $ python manage.py runserver
```

Put in your browser the following url:
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
```

Enter your credentials and add some values to the database. Now you can browse the site!
